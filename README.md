	- Users can draw conclusions as quickly as they could with a spreadsheet calculator (i.e. MS Excel)
- Calx project files can be compiled into standalone programs that can accept new data and give a corresponding output
- Output programs provide interfaces that allow data through a variety of means
	- libp2p distributed application creation
